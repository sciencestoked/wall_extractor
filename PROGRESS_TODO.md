## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current
- **Untested**: Scripts haven't been tested with real data yet
- **Display Dependencies**: May need GUI libraries for image display
- **Large Images**: Memory usage not optimized for very large files
- **Format Support**: Limited to common image formats

### Planned Fixes
- **Testing Phase**: Will identify and fix issues during first runs
- **Memory Optimization**: Implement image streaming for large files
- **Format Expansion**: Add support for more architectural drawing formats
- **Batch Processing**: Improve efficiency for large datasets

## üîß Technical Notes

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV 4.x
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- 4GB+ RAM for typical floor plans
- GUI support for interactive alignment

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Alignment**: ~2-3 minutes per pair (including user interaction)
- **Pre-masking**: ~10-30 seconds per image (depending on size)
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB per 2000x2000 pixel image
- **Storage**: ~10MB per processed image pair

### Configuration Tuning
- **Kernel Size**: Start with (10,10), adjust based on line thickness
- **Window Size**: 1200x800 works for most displays
- **Feature Detection**: 50px window usually sufficient for corner finding
